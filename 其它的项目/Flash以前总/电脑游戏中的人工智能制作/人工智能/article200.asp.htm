0.3 Work in Progress

This is very preliminary, and incomplete, not very nicely formatted,
illogically orderded, etc.. But it IS a starting point.

I'd appreciate any answers you can give to be mailed to me at
sshah@intranet.ca . For those topics that have threads currently underway,
could an interested party summarize the discussions?

This is a relatively new group, and this FAQ has bounced from person to
person and I've (foolishly?) agreed to take it over. Hopefully this will
become the "official" FAQ of comp.ai.games but don't hold your breath.

------------------------------------------------------------

0.4 Netiquette and Related Topics

Some Guidelines to Better Living:

In general, there are several broad areas which can harm the
signal-to-noise ratio in a newsgroup. By taking a little extra care in
posting, we can all help keep the noise down.

First, do not post questions which are answered in the FAQ. The FAQ will be
posted regularly and will also be available by www. DO, however, send
useful information to the keeper of the FAQ, sshah@intranet.ca. That will
help us keep the FAQ useful. The reason some questions are frequently asked
is that the FAQ has dated information and just asking often provides much
more information than reading the FAQ.

Second, do not respond to flames, flame-bait, and other obnoxious posts.
Often, trollers will post false or inflammatory messages and attempt to
whip up a flamewar by working both sides of the debate. Let them flame each
other, there's no need to help them out.

Third, use KEYWORDS. If your post is about chess, put "CHESS:" at the start
of your subject line. This will enable those with smart newsreaders to
automatically select or kill your article. If it's a question, add "Q:" to
the subject line. A larger list of suggested keywords will be included in
the FAQ. Any keywording conventions which arise in the course of the
group's development will also be added.

Fourth, please don't cross-post. If an article is earth-shatteringly
important to more than one group, fine. When following up an article which
is excessively cross-posted, remove the cross-posts. There was a three-
month flamewar/debate over the merits of Ada which would have died if the
original troll hadn't been cross-posted to every comp.lang group in
existance. What finally killed it was a lot of people removing the
excessive cross-posts. If it starts here, let's put it out of our misery
quickly. You can set a Follow-Up To: newsgroup in your article, to let
folks who are interested follow the discussion without taking up more than
one newsgroup.

Finally, if someone is posting in the wrong group, tell them via mail.
There are a lot of newbies out there, and there are more on the way. If we
let a flamewar erupt every time a newbie posts in the wrong place, we'll be
all noise and no signal in no time.

------------------------------------------------------------

0.5 Whom to blame

If you have comments or concerns about this FAQ, please direct them to
Sunir Shah, sshah@intranet.ca.

One thing you may notice is that this FAQ is more an introduction to the
topic of AI in gaming than an actual list of frequently-asked questions.
When the bulk of the FAQ was written, the newsgroup hadn't been around long
enough to have any frequently asked questions. Well, there are a few now.

------------------------------------------------------------

0.6 What's New in this Release?

Sunir Shah has taken over the comp.ai.games FAQ and he has editted it a
bunch. Big changes are the removal of the bulky "summaries of useful c.a.g
threads" section (more of an archive than a summary), I've added a lot to
empty sections and I've probably ended up self-referencing myself about
10348 times (who knows? I'm writing this before I've made those changes).

Hopefully I can guilt Steve Woodcock into keeping those alive on his pages:
                   http://www.cris.com/~swoodcoc/ai.html

If not, I'll download them and store them somewhere accessible.
